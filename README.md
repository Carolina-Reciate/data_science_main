Data Science Nanodegree - Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post
This project is related to the Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity (https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025/dashboard/overview)

I have also written a post at Medium describing this project and the results. It can be accessed here.

This repository consists of only one file: a Jupyter Notebook with all the steps of my Data Science Project

All code are in a way that anyone can run all cells in order and everything should work fine!!

I used a dataset about weather data from Brazil to answer some questions. All the details are very well documented and easy to read inside the notebook.

I followed the logical steps from CRISP-DM, skiping some parts that were not interesting or not needed for this project.

Data Understanding and Collecting
Data Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Presentation of the results/visualizations (Data Viz and Storytelling)
